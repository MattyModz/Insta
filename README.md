This was a fun one to do! See below for the approach and features implemented.

## Reusable Button Component

Extended browser HTML props to a reusable button component for accessibility with type safety and unbiased styling; intended for variations to be mocked up and reused across the app. Opted for vanilla CSS, although this could have been extended to Emotion CSS-in-JS.

## Type Safety for Components

Demonstrated implementation of basic type safety for component files. Further extension would include definite type safety for requested data.

## Testing

Implemented Jest function testing for post timestamp output, found in `Time_stamp_outputtest.test.js`.
